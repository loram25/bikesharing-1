# Bike Sharing in Des Moines, IA
### Module 14 Challenge

## Summary
Let's bring Citibike to Des Moines. Although your first thought may be that Des Moines and New York are totally different, but there are similarities I will discuss that should make Des Moines a profitable venture. We will look at answering the question:

**What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?**

## New York Analysis
Citibike's bikesharing in New York provided great data and insight. Our dataset was mainly focused on Manhattan, so we will compare it to Des Moines. 

There are an estimated 1.63 million people living in Manhattan. In one month, August, there were over 2.3 million bike rides on nearly 14,000 different bikes. As you all may know, Manhattan is an extremely popular tourist destination. There are two types of bike sharing users: customers and subscribers. In this case, we will assume subscribers are locals, commuters, people that use the service year-round and customers are single-use or single-visit users, like tourists. Our focus will be tourist use.

Focusing in on tourists, there were nearly 450,000 rides in August. In 2018, there were 65.1 million (https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/nycdata/tourism/visitors.html) tourists that visited New York city and Manhattan. These rides were concentrated around popular tourist attractions, like Central Park. For the sake of comparison, we can calculate a rough estimate of **0.083 rides per month per tourist, and 4,760 people (tourists and residents) per bike.**

## Des Moines Analysis
Let's use those estimates with the demographics of Des Moines. In 2017, Des Moines attracted 13.7 million tourists (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/articles/post/des-moines-draws-record-number-of-visitors-to-region/). in 2018, Des Moines reported a population of nearly 217,000. Although the population may be nearly 10 times less than Manhattan, Des Moines has twice the number of tourists per person. This fact is great for a bike-sharing venture.

Our initial estimate for Des Moines investment is **2,923 bikes** and approximate revenue potential of just over **92,000 rides per month**. Althought looking at bike utilization in New York, it appears we should start with a smaller amount of bikes to ensure utilization and minimize initial investment requirement. An ammended investment could be **1,000 bikes**.

The downtown core of Des Moines has a multitude of events, restaurants and tourist activities available (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/?skip=0&sort=qualityScore&subcatids=2210&regionids=122%2C123). This area should act as a good parallel to Central Park and pier areas of Manhattan.

## Conclusion
Based on the tourist numbers and concentration of tourist activites, an investment in Des Moines bike sharing is a prudent one. It may not generate the same revenue as New York, but it may proof to be just as profitable.
